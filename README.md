# SDK-Generator

A powerful and modern SDK generator built for Unreal Engine projects.

## Overview

SDK-Generator parses Unreal Engine game data and produces a clean, accessible SDK structure for development, tooling, analysis, and reverse-engineering research.

## Features

* Automatic SDK generation from Unreal Engine assets
* Fast, optimized parsing
* Clean and organized output structure
* Ideal for learning, analysis, and tooling development

## How It Works
